# Java Script

# VARIABLE DECLARATION:
3 Ways to declare a variable

1.var
    we couls change the variable value and use the variable for the entire program.

2.let
    we could use the variable only in the declaration block.

3.const
    We can't change the variable value after declaration.

# storing variables with assignment operator





#  PRIMITIVES

string,number,boolean,null,undefined,symbol(added in ECMAscript 6) - These are primitive data types

Primitive data types are immutable which means we can't change the values.

1. while we copy data seperate memory space is created. if we change original value, copy value dosen't change

# NON-PRIMITIVES

Objects,(arrays etc)

non-primitives are mutable, means we can change the original value diectly.

1. while we copy data no memory is allocated the copy variable is pointed to same memory location, if we change gthe original value then the copy also changes.
    To avoid this we use spread operator (spread operator=...)
